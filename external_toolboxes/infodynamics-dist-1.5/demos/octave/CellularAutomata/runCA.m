%    Existing sources of memory leakage:
%     - assigning CA(s) = ca <- should copy ca
%     - use of circshift function. Could construct our own vector and copy elements.
%
% This function executes the given 1D (wolfram) cellular automata rule number.
% 
% *NOTE* This function will not work properly with (base)^(base^neighbourhood) > 2^31 - 1
% (e.g. will not work for base 2, neighbourhood 5)
% until the use of long integers can be investigated.
%
% Inputs:
% - neighbourhood - neighbourhood size for the rule (ECA has neighbourhood 3).
%     For an even size neighbourhood (meaning a different number of neighbours on each side of the cell),
%     we take an extra cell from the lower cell indices (i.e. from the left).
%     The offset of parents can be generated from: ceil(-n / 2) : 1 : ceil(-n / 2) + (n-1), where n is neighbourhood size
% - base - number of discrete states for each cell (for binary states this is 2)
% - rule - supplied as either:
%     a. an integer rule number if <= 2^31 - 1 (Wolfram style; e.g. 110, 54 are the complex ECA rules)
%     b. a HEX string, e.g. phi_par from Mitchell et al. is '0xfeedffdec1aaeec0eef000a0e1a020a0' (note: the leading 0x is not required)
% - cells - number of cells in the CA
% - steps - number of rows to execute the CA for (including the random initial row)
% - debug - turn on various debug messages
% - seedOrState (optional) - if a scalar, it is the state input for the random number generator (so one can repeat CA investigations for the same initial state).
%                          - if a vector, it is the initial state for the CA (must be of length cells)
%
% Outputs:
% - caStates - a run, from random initial conditions, of a CA of the given parameters.
% - ruleTable - the lookup table for each neighbourhood configuration, constructed from the rule number
% - executedRules - which CA rule was executed for every cell update that occurred for the CA.
