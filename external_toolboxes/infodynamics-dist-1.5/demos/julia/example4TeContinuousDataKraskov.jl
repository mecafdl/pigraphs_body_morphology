# = Example 4 - Transfer entropy on continuous data using Kraskov estimators =

# Simple transfer entropy (TE) calculation on continuous-valued data using the Kraskov-estimator TE calculator.

# Import the JavaCall package:
using JavaCall;

# Change location of jar to match yours:
jarLocation = "../../infodynamics.jar";
# Start the JVM supplying classpath and heap size
#  (increase memory here if you get crashes due to not enough space)
JavaCall.init(["-Djava.class.path=$(jarLocation)", "-Xmx128M"]);

# Generate some random normalised data.
numObservations = 1000;
covariance=0.4;
sourceArray=randn(numObservations);
destArray = [0, covariance*sourceArray[1:numObservations-1] + (1-covariance)*randn(numObservations - 1)];
sourceArray2=randn(numObservations); # Uncorrelated source

# Create a TE calculator and run it:
teClass = @jimport infodynamics.measures.continuous.kraskov.TransferEntropyCalculatorKraskov;
teCalc=teClass(());
jcall(teCalc, "setProperty", Void, (JString, JString), "k", "4"); # Use Kraskov parameter K=4 for 4 nearest points
jcall(teCalc, "initialise", Void, (jint, ), 1); # Use history length 1 (Schreiber k=1)
# Perform calculation with correlated source:
jcall(teCalc, "setObservations", Void, (Array{jdouble,1}, Array{jdouble,1}),
				     sourceArray, destArray);
result = jcall(teCalc, "computeAverageLocalOfObservations", jdouble, ());
# Note that the calculation is a random variable (because the generated
#  data is a set of random variables) - the result will be of the order
#  of what we expect, but not exactly equal to it; in fact, there will
#  be a large variance around it.
# Expected correlation is expected covariance / product of expected standard deviations:
#  (where square of destArray standard dev is sum of squares of std devs of
#  underlying distributions)
corr_expected = covariance / (1 * sqrt(covariance^2 + (1-covariance)^2));
@printf("TE result %.4f nats; expected to be close to %.4f nats for these correlated Gaussians\n",
    result, -0.5*log(1-corr_expected^2));

# Perform calculation with uncorrelated source:
jcall(teCalc, "initialise", Void, ()); # Initialise leaving the parameters the same
jcall(teCalc, "setObservations", Void, (Array{jdouble,1}, Array{jdouble,1}),
				     sourceArray2, destArray);
result2 = jcall(teCalc, "computeAverageLocalOfObservations", jdouble, ());
@printf("TE result %.4f nats; expected to be close to 0 nats for these uncorrelated Gaussians\n", result2);

# We can also compute the local TE values for the time-series samples here:
#  (See more about utility of local TE in the CA demos)
localTE = jcall(teCalc, "computeLocalOfPreviousObservations", Array{jdouble,1}, ());
@printf("Notice that the mean of locals, %.4f nats, equals the previous result\n",
	sum(localTE)/(numObservations-1));
